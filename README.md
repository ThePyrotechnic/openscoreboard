## Testing on Windows
Until https://github.com/ThePyrotechnic/demoinfogo-linux is built for Windows, demos must be processed on Linux. There is a pre-processed output file in `tmp` until this is resolved.

To use this file when testing, run `demoinfogo <any_name>.dem --skip-processing` (put anything in place of `<any_name>`; the demo file doesn't get touched if `--skip-processing` is passed as an argument.
